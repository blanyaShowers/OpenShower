# OpenShower: One Place for Sensations & Sophistication
OpenShower (OS) is a fully open, modular shower system designed to save water and energy — focused on delivering the best shower experience without the need to spend thousands of dollars or modify your bathroom installation. Thanks to its all-in-one, ready-to-use design, you can build it, customize it, and repair it yourself — driven by the vision that owning a premium shower should be as simple as buying a coffee machine.

OpenShower reinvents the shower experience by eliminating invisible waste and making each session more efficient and sustainable. With a 19-liter tank, it sets a natural water limit that encourages better habits without compromising comfort. The exact amount of water is preheated and delivered instantly, reducing waste during heat-up. Automatic pressure control eliminates the need for manual adjustments, saving time and optimizing water use. The transparent cylinder shows real-time water usage, while the top display reveals insights you’ve likely never seen before.
